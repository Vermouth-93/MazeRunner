# MazeRunner
This project is a game about a Harry Potter, the main character 
who tries to find his way through the maze to reach the Triwizard Tournament Cup
withouth getting killed by monsters and 
collecting gifts on his way to increase his score.

This game was developped equally by me and another 3 college mates.
They don't have Github accounts, that's why I can't add them as collaborators.
This game was developped and finished a year ago for a college assignment.
